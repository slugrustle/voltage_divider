# Voltage Divider Calculator

This program finds two-resistor voltage dividers
created from real-world resistor values (EIA E24
and/or E96) with divider ratios closest to some
target. Resistor tolerance and overall divider string
resistance are taken into account. The calculator is
a single .html file with inline Javascript.

## Getting Started

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/slugrustle/voltage_divider/releases)
of voltage\_divider.html and run it in any browser that supports modern
Javascript and HTML/CSS.

## Contributing

I would love to receive bug reports and user
feedback. If you have improvements to the code,
please get in touch.
